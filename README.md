# KORRA
## **An Ultra-Rare Backend Engineering System**
Languages: C, Rust, Java, TypeScript (no frontend)
- **Purpose**: Real-time decentralized coordination, intelligence propagation, and compute integrity across multi-agent backend systems.

## Core Concept
KORRA is a Zero-Trust Autonomous Coordination Platform â€” a backend-only project designed to:

- Run intelligent compute agents on decentralized nodes

- Securely coordinate communication and decision-making

- Validate agent behavior through cryptographic trails

- Propagate mission-critical updates via efficient consensus

- Simulate global-state convergence via hybrid control logic
